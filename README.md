# iTECH-Hack
It is a social networking application for inter and intra college students to share their ideas and collaborate with each other on their projects. 
With this, the whole community of the students will grow. Students can share the events, conferences workshops happening in their college with other 
college students so they can participate in those. This way students get exposed to whatâ€™s happening outside their academics.

Through this project we attempt to provide a complete go to place for students to connect and collaborate with other students and build projects 
to solve real-world problems.
